Waterfall Model Overview
Introduction
The Waterfall Model is a fundamental software development methodology that outlines a linear and
sequential approach. Each stage must be completed before moving to the next.
Stages of the Waterfall Model
1. **Requirements analysis and definition**: 
- Establishing the system's services, constraints, and goals in consultation with system users.
- Defining them in detail to serve as a system specification.
2. **System and software design**: 
- Allocating the requirements to either hardware or software systems.
- Establishing an overall system architecture.
- Identifying and describing the fundamental software system abstractions and their relationships.
3. **Implementation and unit testing**: 
- Realizing the software design as a set of programs or program units.
- Verifying that each unit meets its specification.
4. **Integration and system testing**: 
- Integrating and testing individual program units or programs as a complete system.
- Ensuring that the software requirements have been met.
- Delivering the system to the customer.
5. **Operation and maintenance**:

- Installing the system and putting it into practical use.
- Correcting errors not discovered in earlier stages.
- Improving the implementation of system units.
- Enhancing the system's services as new requirements are discovered.
Additional Notes
The Waterfall Model is particularly appropriate for:
- Embedded systems where the software has to interface with hardware systems.
- Critical systems requiring extensive safety and security analysis.
- Large software systems that are part of broader engineering systems developed by several partner
companies.
