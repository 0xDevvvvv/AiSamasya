Introduction to Design Thinking  
 Design Thinking is a design methodology that provides a solution -based 
approach to solving problems.  
 Design thinking is a non -linear, iterative process that teams use to 
understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine prob lems and create 
innovative solutions to prototype and test.  
 
Iterative Design Thinking Process  
 Consist of five phases -Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test.  
  It is most useful to solve problems that are ill -defined (unclear) or unknown.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Empathize  
 Designer should gain an empathetic understanding of the problem that 
they are trying to solve, typically through user research.  
 Empathy is crucial to a human -centered design process such as design 
thinking because it allows you to set aside your own assumptions 
about the world and gain real insight into users and their needs.  Place 
yourself as an end user and identify the user expectations and needs.  
 Depending on time constraints, a substantial amount of information is 
gathered at this stage to use during the next stage and to develop the 
best possible understanding of the users, their needs, and the problems 
that underlie the development of that particular product.  
 
2. Define  
 It's time to accumulate the information gathered during the Empathize 
stage.  
 You then analyze your observations and synthesize them to define the 
core problems you and your team have identified. These definitions 
are called problem statements.  
 Problem statements are concise description of design problems.  
 Design team use th em to define the current and ideal states to 
freely find user centered solutions.  
 The problem definition should be clear and unambiguous.  
 Define your point of view – meaningful and actionable problem 
statement.  
 
3. Ideate  
 The solid background of knowledge from the first two phases means 
you can start to think outside the box", look for alternative ways to 
view the problem and identify innovative solutions to the problem 
statement you've created.   Ideate= transition from ide ntifying problems to exploring solutions . 
 Ideation is leveraged to:   
o Harness the collective perspectives and strengths of your team.  
o Step beyond obvious solutions and drive innovation.  
o Uncover unexpected areas of exploration.  
o Create fluency (volume)  and flexibility (variety)in  your 
innovation  options.  
 Brainstorming is particularly useful here.  
 Brainstorming is a method design teams use to generate ideas to solve 
clearly defined design problems.  
 Brainwrite is another way of expressing ideas.  
o The participants write down their ideas on paper.  
o They pass on their own piece of paper to another participant.  
o The other participant elaborates on the first person’s ideas and 
so forth.  
o Another few minutes later, the individual participants will again 
pass t heir papers on to someone else and so the process 
continues.  
o The process takes 15 minutes.  
o Ideas are discussed afterwards.  
 
4. Prototype  
 This is an experimental phase.  
 This could involve simply paper prototyping, simulations, 3D models, 
animations etc.  
 The aim is to identify the best possible solution for each problem 
found.  
 Prototypes maybe shared and tested within the team and a small group 
of people outside the design team.  
 The solutions are investigated and either accepted, improved and 
reexamined, or re jected.  
 By the end of this stage, the design team will have a better idea of the 
constraints inherent  to the  product.   
 
 
 
5. Test 
 Evaluators rigorously test the prototypes.   
 Although this is the final phase, design thinking is iterative: Teams 
often use th e results to redefine one or more further problems.  
 So, they can return to previous stages to make further iterations, 
alterations and refinements to identify the best alternative solution.  
 During this phase, alterations and refinements are done.

DESIGN THINKING AS DIVERGENT -
CONVERGENT QUESTIONING  
Design thinking is an iterative approach and we follows two generic patterns of 
design thinking: Divergent thinking and Convergent thinking .  
Divergent thinking is the process of thinking that explores multiple possible 
solutions in order to generate creative ideas. i.e. Think for all possible ways to 
reach a solution.  
Convergent Thinking is the process of figuring out a concrete solution to  any 
problem. i.e. Thinks for a finaI solution.

DESIGN THINKING AS A TEAM  
 
In order to get best and creative solutions, design thinking process is generally 
performed as a team activity.  
Every member may raise their own ideas and solutions.  
The team will analyze the pros and cons of each solution or design and then 
finalize the  best suitable solution.  
But during design thinking as a team activity, conflicts between team members 
may arise. So It is very important to resolve these conflicts.  
 
CHARACTERISTICS OF AN EFFECTIVE TEAM  
 
Team goals are as important as individual goals.   
The team understands the goals and is committed to achieving them.   
Trust replaces fear, and people feel comfortable taking risks.   
Respect, collaboration, and open -mindedness are prevalent.   Team members communicate readily; diversity of opinions is e ncouraged.  
Decisions are made by consensus and have the acceptance and support of the 
members of the team.  
 
STEPS IN RESOLVING CONFLICTS   
 
1. Prepare the resolution  
2. Understand the situation  
3. Reach agreement  
 
Step 1: Prepare for resolution  
 
 Acknowledge the conflict -The conflict has to be acknowledged before it 
can be managed and resolved. The tendency is for people to ignore the first 
signs of conflict, perhaps as it seems trivial, or is difficult to differentiate 
from the normal, healthy de bate that teams can thrive on. If you are 
concerned about the conflict in your team, discuss it with other members. 
Once the team recognizes the issue, it can start the process of resolution.  
 Discuss the impact -As a team, discuss the impact the conflict is having on 
team dynamics and performance.  
 Agree to a cooperative process -Everyone involved must agree to 
cooperate in to resolve the conflict. This means putting the team first, and 
may involve setting aside your opinion or ideas for the time being. If  
someone wants to win more than he or she wants to resolve the conflict, you 
may find yourself at a stalemate.  
 Agree to communicate - The most important thing throughout the 
resolution process is for everyone to keep communications open.  
 
Step 2: Understa nd the situation  
 
 Clarify positions  - Whatever the conflict or disagreement, it's important to 
clarify people's positions. Whether there are obvious factions within the 
team who support a particular option, approach or idea, or each team 
member holds their  own unique view, each position needs to be clearly 
identified and articulated by those involved.   
 List facts, assumptions and beliefs underlying each position  -What does 
each group or person believe? What do they value? What information are 
they using as  a basis for these beliefs? What decision -making criteria and 
processes have they employed?   
 Analyze in smaller groups  - Break the team into smaller groups, separating people who are in alliance. In these smaller groups, analyze and dissect each 
position,  and the associated facts, assumptions and beliefs.  
 Convene back as a team  - After the group dialogue, each side is likely to be 
much closer to reaching agreement. The process of uncovering facts and 
assumptions allows people to step away from their emoti onal attachments 
and see the issue more objectively. When you separate alliances, the fire of 
conflict can burn out quickly, and it is much easier to see the issue and facts 
laid bare.  
 
Step 3: Reach agreement   
 
Now that all parties understand the others'  positions, the team must decide what 
decision or course of action to take. With the facts and assumptions considered, it's 
easier to see the best of action and reach agreement.  
 
PREVENTING CONFLICTS  
 
Dealing with conflict immediately -avoid the temptation to ignore it.  
Being open -if people have issues, they need to be expressed immediately.  
Practicing clear communication -articulate thoughts and ideas clearly.   
Practicing active listening -paraphra sing, clarifying, questioning.   
Practicing identifying assumptions -asking yourself "why" on a regular basis.   
Not letting conflict get personal -stick to facts and issues, not personalities.   
Focusing on actionable solutions -don't belabor what can't be  changed.  
Encouraging different points of view -insist on honest dialogue and expressing 
feelings.  
Not looking for blame -encourage ownership of the problem and solution.  
Demonstrating respect -if the situation escalates, take a break and wait for emotio ns 
to subside.
